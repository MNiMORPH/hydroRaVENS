# :black_nib: HydroRaVENS
**Rain and Variable Evapotranspiration, Nieve, and Streamflow**

<!-- start-intro -->

HydroRaVENS is a lumped, daily-timestep conceptual hydrological model. It routes precipitation through an optional snowpack stage and then through a cascade of one or more linear reservoirs (soil zone, groundwater, etc.), producing streamflow. Evapotranspiration is either read from a data file or computed with the Thornthwaite–Chang 2019 equation, and is scaled per water year so that the long-run water balance closes. The model follows the [CSDMS Basic Model Interface (BMI)](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI).

```

To install from source for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MNiMORPH/hydroRaVENS.git
cd hydroRaVENS
pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

**Python API**

```python
import hydroravens

b = hydroravens.Buckets()
b.initialize('config.yml')
b.run()
b.compute_NSE(verbose=True)
b.plot()
```

**Command-line interface**

```bash
hydroravens -y config.yml
```

See the [Quick Start guide](https://hydroravens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for the configuration file format and input data requirements.
