hydroravens.calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run hydroRaVENS with a given parameter set and return a CalibResult
named tuple containing the goodness-of-fit score, AIC, baseflow index,
flow duration curve, end-of-run reservoir states, and the Buckets object.

Intended use: call run_and_score() from a Dakota driver or any other
optimizer. Set spin_up_cycles: 0 in the YAML config; run_and_score()
manages spin-up itself using the calibrated parameters. If the YAML
requests spin-up cycles, initialize() will run them before the parameter
overrides are applied, so those cycles use uncalibrated values.

Supported metrics
-----------------
'NSE'    Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency.  Biased toward high flows because its
         denominator is the variance of observed discharge (dominated by
         peaks).  Use as a baseline or when peaks are the primary concern.

'KGE'    Kling-Gupta Efficiency.  Decomposes fit into correlation (r),
         variability ratio (alpha = std_mod/std_obs), and bias ratio
         (beta = mean_mod/mean_obs), weighting all three equally.
         Better balanced across the full flow range than NSE.

'logKGE' KGE applied to log-transformed flows.  Shifts sensitivity toward
         low flows and base flow; useful when base flow matters as much as
         peaks.  A small epsilon (1 % of mean observed flow) is added
         before taking logs to avoid log(0).

'KGE_logKGE'
         Equal-weight average of KGE and logKGE: 0.5*KGE + 0.5*logKGE.
         Balances sensitivity to peaks (KGE) and low flows (logKGE).
         Recommended when neither regime should dominate calibration.
         Following Yilmaz et al. (2008, WRR), who show that no single
         metric captures both high- and low-flow behaviour; this composite
         is the single-objective analogue of their multi-segment FDC
         approach.

AIC
---
AIC = N * ln(SS_res_log / N) + 2k, where SS_res_log is the sum of squared
residuals on log-transformed flows and k is the number of free parameters
passed to run_and_score().  Log-transforming flows makes the Gaussian
residual assumption more defensible for discharge data.  AIC is intended
for comparing models with different numbers of reservoirs; lower is better.

Baseflow index (BFI)
--------------------
Computed with the Eckhardt (2005) recursive digital filter applied to both
observed and modelled specific discharge within the scoring window.
BFI = baseflow volume / total flow volume.  alpha=0.98 and bfi_max=0.80
are standard values for perennial daily streamflow.

Flow duration curve (FDC)
--------------------------
Discharge at 99 evenly-spaced exceedance probabilities (0.5–99.5 %).
Stored as pd.Series indexed by exceedance probability (%) in both
CalibResult.fdc_obs and CalibResult.fdc_mod.

Chaining decades
----------------
run_and_score() returns final_states, a dict of reservoir water depths and
snowpack SWE at the end of the scored run.  Pass this as initial_states to
the next decade's run_and_score() call with spin_up_cycles=0 so that water
storage is physically continuous across decade boundaries.

    Route a runoff time series through a Nash cascade of N identical
    linear reservoirs, each with storage time constant K [days].

    The cascade impulse response (instantaneous unit hydrograph) is a
    two-parameter gamma distribution:

        h(t) = t^(N-1) * exp(-t/K) / (K^N * Gamma(N))

    with mean travel time N*K [days] and variance N*K^2 [days^2].  For
    N = 1 the response reduces to a single exponential.

    Each reservoir is updated with the exact analytical solution for
    piecewise-constant inflow over a timestep dt:

        S_i(t+dt) = S_i(t) * exp(-dt/K)  +  K * Q_{i-1}(t) * (1 - exp(-dt/K))
        Q_i(t+dt) = S_i(t+dt) / K

    This form is unconditionally stable for any K > 0 and dt > 0, unlike
    the forward-Euler discretisation which requires dt/K < 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : array-like, shape (T,)
        Runoff input time series [mm/day].
    N : int
        Number of linear reservoirs in series (shape parameter).
        N = 2 is typical for medium-sized catchments (area ~ 10^3 km^2).
    K : float
        Storage time constant of each reservoir [days] (scale parameter).
        Mean travel time through the cascade is N * K.
    dt : float, optional
        Timestep [days].  Default 1.0.

    For a linear reservoir with constant mean inflow Q̄_in and dt = 1 day:

    allows spin-up cycles to converge faster because short-timescale
    reservoirs start near equilibrium too -- only transient variability
    (seasonal cycles, wet/dry year sequences) needs to be resolved by
    spin-up rather than the slow drift from an arbitrary starting depth.

    Run hydroRaVENS and return a CalibResult named tuple.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : str
        Path to a YAML configuration file. Should have spin_up_cycles: 0
        so that spin-up is performed here with the calibrated parameters.
    t_efold : list of float, optional
        E-folding residence times [days], one per reservoir (shallowest
        first). Overrides the values in cfg.
    f_to_discharge : list of float, optional
        Exfiltration fractions to stream, one per reservoir except the
        deepest (which is always 1.0). Overrides the values in cfg.
    Hmax : list of float, optional
        Maximum effective water depths [mm], one per reservoir. Overrides
        the values in cfg.
    melt_factor : float, optional
        Degree-day snowmelt factor [mm SWE per degC per day]. Overrides
        the value in cfg.
    direct_runoff_fraction : float or None, optional
        Fraction (0–1) of positive daily recharge that bypasses the
        reservoir cascade and exits directly as runoff.  Conceptually
        inspired by Hortonian (infiltration-excess) overland flow, but
        at a daily timestep rainfall intensity is unavailable, so the
        fraction is not a rigorous physical representation -- except in
        extreme events where intense rainfall dominates the daily total.
        In practice it acts as a calibrated fast-bypass fraction.
        None (default) leaves the value from the YAML config (itself
        defaulting to 0; off by default).
    fdd_threshold : float or None, optional
        Frozen ground index threshold [°C·day].  The frozen ground index
        accumulates freezing degree-days and decays during warming
        (Molnau & Bissell 1983, https://westernsnowconference.org/bibliography/1983Molnau.pdf).  When the index
        exceeds fdd_threshold, infiltration from the top reservoir to
        deeper layers is set to zero for that timestep (all drainage
        becomes direct runoff).  None (default) disables the effect.
    snow_insulation_k : float or None, optional
        Snow insulation decay constant [mm⁻¹ SWE].  Scales the effective
        air temperature reaching the soil as T_eff = T · exp(-k · SWE),
        reducing FGI accumulation under a deep snowpack.  Applied to
        both freezing and thawing temperature forcing; excess degree-days
        from meltwater (excess_dd) are not scaled because meltwater
        delivers heat directly to the soil surface.  None (default)
        leaves the value from cfg (itself defaulting to 0.0, i.e. no
        insulation).  Literature values: LISFLOOD uses ~0.057 mm⁻¹;
        GSSHA default is 0.5 (units ambiguous in original source).
    initial_states : dict, optional
        Starting reservoir water depths, snowpack SWE, and frozen ground
        index, as returned by a previous call's CalibResult.final_states.
        Format::

            {'reservoirs': [H_shallow, H_deep, ...],
             'snowpack':    H_snow_SWE,
             'fgi':         frozen_ground_index}

        When provided, these override the H0 values from cfg.  Use with
        spin_up_cycles=0 when chaining consecutive decades so that water
        storage and frozen-ground state are physically continuous.
        When None (default), reservoirs are initialised to their
        analytical steady-state depths before spin-up (see
        :func:`_steady_state_depths`).
    start : str or datetime-like, optional
        Start of the scoring window (inclusive). Score, AIC, BFI, and FDC
        are all computed within this window. Spin-up still uses the full
        record.
    end : str or datetime-like, optional
        End of the scoring window (inclusive). Same as start.
    spin_up_cycles : int or None, optional
        Number of times to loop the full record before the scored run.
        ``None`` (default) auto-computes as
        ``ceil(tau_max / record_length)``, where ``tau_max`` is the
        longest reservoir e-folding time after parameter overrides and
        ``record_length`` is the number of days in the input record.
        Because initial conditions are set to analytical steady-state
        depths, one e-folding time is sufficient to resolve the seasonal
        and inter-annual climate memory.  Set to 0 when providing
        initial_states for chained decade runs.
    metric : {'KGE', 'NSE', 'logKGE', 'KGE_logKGE', 'KGE_logKGE_logFDC', 'KGE_logKGE_logFDC_BFI'}, optional
        Goodness-of-fit metric.  Default is 'KGE'.
        ``'KGE_logKGE'`` returns 0.5*KGE + 0.5*logKGE, balancing
        peak and low-flow performance (Yilmaz et al. 2008).
        ``'KGE_logKGE_logFDC_BFI'`` adds a BFI bias-ratio score
        (1 - |BFI_mod/BFI_obs - 1|) as a fourth equal-weight component.
    routing_N : int, optional
        Number of identical linear reservoirs in the Nash cascade used
        for channel routing (shape parameter of the gamma IUH).
        Default is 2.  Set routing_K to enable routing; routing_N is
        counted as a free parameter in k only when it is explicitly
        calibrated (the caller must add 1 to the k count via
        run_and_score if routing_N is varied).
    routing_K : float or None, optional
        Storage time constant [days] of each Nash-cascade reservoir
        (scale parameter).  Mean travel time through the cascade is
        routing_N * routing_K.  When None (default), no routing is
        applied and the model output is compared directly to observed
        discharge.  When provided, routing_K is counted as one free
        parameter.
    modules : dict or None, optional
        Enable/disable optional process modules.  Keys: ``'snowpack'``,
        ``'frozen_ground'``, ``'rain_on_snow'``, ``'direct_runoff'``.
        Values: bool.  Overrides the ``modules`` block in the YAML config.
        Absent keys leave the YAML/default value unchanged.
    enforce_water_balance : bool, optional
        Whether to scale ET by a per-water-year multiplier so that
        P - Q - ET = 0 over each water year.  Default True.  Set to
        False only when supplying trusted measured ET that should not
        be corrected; see Buckets.initialize().  Overrides the
        enforce_water_balance key in the YAML config.
